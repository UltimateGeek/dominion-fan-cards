> **Design a card (shaped thing) with an effect that can only be used once per game**
>
> I'm looking for more effects like Seize the Day. Where you think about the whole game and when to deploy the "once per game" effect. These kinds of decisions are in every dominion game (e.g. when to start greening), but a good "once per game" effect will provide even more opportunities.
>
> I'll be judging on the basis of cards where the "once per game" looms large in the player's mind and isn't a trivial or obvious decision. It doesn't have to be game warping - it could be minor and only matter for players who choose a strategy involving the card. But I want players to think about when to pull the trigger.
>
> Most Projects aren't what I really have in mind as they're largely positive and don't feel all that different from buying a card.  However I'm not going to make hard and fast "rules" about it as for example something like Inheritance has "once per game" in its text but it functions more like a Project.
>
> The only rule is something technically that means the effect once per game, per player at most. So all Projects would "qualify". Something like Mountain Pass that's once per game across all players is also acceptable. Supply piles of one card are acceptable, but try keep it within the spirit of the contest - it shouldn't be bought many times in most games due to a "return to the supply" effect.
>
> Once per game was an option for last week but it wasn't explored that often. Additionally, this week it need not relate to buying/gaining.  A Village, no buy restrictions, with a once per game additional effect would be a great entrant.
>
> Edit: Oneshot Heirlooms do qualify, as long as they can't be gained back most of the time (e.g. if the card the Heirloom is paired with can gain from the trash). If you want to submit an heirloom you must also pair it with a card (shaped thing), which may or may not also have a "once per game" effect.

> Once per game: Trash 4 Action cards you have in play to gain a Province.

## Review
by NoMoreFun

> I think this would work fine without the once per game in Kingdoms. Trashing 4 Actions and still paying $5 is quite a hefty cost, especially if you mistime a province gain. A good event.
