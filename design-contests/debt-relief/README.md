# Debt Relief
Post: [Weekly Design Contest #150: Half!](http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=21192.0)
by JW, 2022 Apr 25

> *Design a card or landscape that contains the word or concept of "half" (or its equivalent). Sample card: Bishop.*
>
> *Other rules and suggestions (adapted from 4est's previous contests):*
> "Per $2 it costs", "Divided by 2," "halved", etc. are all acceptable wordings.
> I will accept heirlooms, artifacts, split piles, non-Supply cards etc., as part of your submission, but keep things to no more than two cards/landscapes.
> Don't make me squint. Eliminate unnecessary words and complexity where possible.
>
> *Judgement Details:*
> Entries and revisions must be submitted by just before midnight UTC on Monday, May 2. I'll try to have results posted the next day.
> Entries will be judged on ingenuity, balance, simplicity, and creative/appropriate use of the concept of "half."

## Review
by JW

> A good use of a once-per game effect. Having a one-time event be a "must buy" seems like less of an issue than it would be on a Kingdom card as long as it doesn't completely transform your deck and eliminate much of the chance from the game (see: Donate). I believe that, most of the time, "double your $" would have the same impact though there are plenty of exceptions like Ball or Horn of Plenty, which offer nice interactions. **Short list.**

Awarded an Honorable mention.
