# Intoxicate
Post: [Weekly Design Contest 145: Down the hatch!](http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=21104.0)

> Allies is around the corner! Previews have dropped! Dominion now has 14 expansions in its catalogue. 14!
>
> This calls for a celebration! Bring out the Champaign, because this contest is all about alcohol. And, well, nothing much more beyond that, actually. It’s pretty simple really: just make a card that invokes alcohol thematically.
>
> It doesn’t need to be as straightforward as a mug o’ beer. A keg is as acceptable of a card as would be a bar or a brew master. Or how about a nice branch of hops? Anyway, these are just quick ideas to get you going. Go nuts beyond that. But remember: t’has to do with alcohol!
>
> Some extra rules include:
> * Actually, not many extra rules. You can do a Landscape card if you want. Or send multiple cards at once, such as with split piles or Travelers. I will say though that I prefer when only one card is submitted. Makes it easier to judge, lol.
>
> Judging will be, of course, based on whether or not your card(s) match the requested theme. That’s like, a mandatory thing. And, well, how much the effects of your card(s) use said theme. That's kind of important too. Otherwise, tip of the judge: I’ll admit that I’m biased toward simpler cards. I mean, we’re celebrating with alcohol here, I’m way past the point where I can read a novel on a card! :D

> Short story? I love this.
>
> Okay, we all know this is no Dominion jargon. And this is trying to do something Dominion doesn’t want to be. I usually care about staying by-the-book, but I love this too much to give it some flak. Man, I’d add a + to this. Give Herbalist some competition! Cheap +Buys can exist and have before; Intoxicate also adds some funny debauchery in there!
