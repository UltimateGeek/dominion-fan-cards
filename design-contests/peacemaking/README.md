## Review

> This is my favorite of the Landscape Liaisons (despite it not technically being a liaison). The Allies are such that this would be easily worth $5 with some Allies, and possibly not worth buying for $4 with others. But it's less bad for a landscape to be dead some games than for a kingdom card. **Finalist**
