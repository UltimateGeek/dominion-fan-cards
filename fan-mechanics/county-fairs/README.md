> Here's an idea that I've termed burn abilities. Only playable portrait cards can have burn abilities. While a card with one is in play, its burn ability can be activated at any time for an extra effect; in exchange, the card is set aside a la Encampment (no longer 'in play', but still there to help tracking) to be trashed at Clean-up. All these rules are indicated by a below-line flame symbol.

## Review
by Acquila

> Rotating split pile focused on the powerful top trasher and the bottom VP card. As yet, I've had no play experience with rotating piles.
>
> * +: scaling payload in Ride Ticket could be interesting in a rotating pile.
> * -: The best Treasure Ticket Booth can get is often Silver; it helps to patch up economy loss from Park & Ride trashing, but is still a weak . There's no urgent rush to trash the State Fairs since they're cantrips, so Ride Ticket won't often do much.
> * Overview: Park & Ride is very desirable, so these County Fairs will likely rotate. Ticket Booth could easily be ignored unless a nice  Treasure is in the game. Ride Ticket could become a cheap Gold later, and until then will be skipped. State Fair is a good pick-up worth contesting, an easier Distant Lands.
>
> So, as is, the game flow with this pile seems quite scripted, and the two middle cards could be strengthened with more independent use.

Not selected.
