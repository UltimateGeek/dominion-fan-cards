> Sneak is an ability that you can use *any time on your turn other than clean-up, but only once per turn*. It can be used before resolving beginning-of-turn effects, in the Night phase, or any time in between. When a card has the Sneak type, it means you can play it using its Sneak ability, indicated by the text "Sneak:", instead of its regular ability. So, if a card has both the Sneak and Action types, it means that once per turn, you're allowed to play the card at any time using its Sneak ability, but then any other plays of the card (or copies of it) have to be in the Action phase, using its Action ability. The Sneak type is indicated by a dark blue color, and Sneak - Action cards should have both colors.

> Also, I'd like some feedback on how well you think this mechanic works overall. My main concern is boards with more than one Sneak card on them. It seems possible that, because of the once per turn restriction, one of the Sneak cards would end up with only its plain ability being used. I thought about making the restriction instead "once per turn per pile", but that seems too complicated. Does anyone have any other ideas?

## Review
by Commodore Chuckles

> Fun fact: My Jackpot thread had this exact same card, but with a different name. Great minds think alike, I guess. So yeah, the fact that I already came up with this idea is a good indication that I like it. The main struggle I had, and still have, with the idea is that it's difficult to balance. If there are no Villages, then you can play a maximum of two of these, and since the Sneak play decreases your hand size, then you only managed to increase your hand size by one overall. Of course, Ghost Ship is an official card that only gives you one extra card while decreasing everyone else's hands, but... it's also one of the most hated cards in the game. I guess only playtesting could tell if this idea is actually fun.
